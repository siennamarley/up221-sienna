# Profile

Hi my name is Sienna and I am a second year MPH student in Enviornmental Health Science. I am interested in UP 221 to build upon my skills from GEOG7 at the graduate level. My goals for this class would like to feel comfortable handling large datasets. 

# Description of the Course
Designed to familiarize students with use of geographic data in public policy, urban planning, and related practice, and develop skill base for community practice that provides each student with tools necessary to organize and plan effectively for political, economic, and social justice in our communities. Students learn how to use geographic information systems (GIS) to inform practice, advocacy, and policy work. 

# Project ideas
- Extreme heat and air quality
